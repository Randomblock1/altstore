## How To Use
1. Install AltStore Beta.
2. Go to 'Browse' tab
3. In the top right, tap 'Sources'
4. Add whatever sources you want
5. Download your shiny new apps

Or, if you just want the IPAs:
1. Visit this site: https://altsource.by.lao.sb/browse/?source=https%3A%2F%2Frandomblock1.com%2Faltstore%2Fapps.json
2. Choose â€œDownload IPA" from the app you want to install
3. Use the share sheet to import the ipa into altstore

## No beta? No problem!
I don't like how AltStore Sources have been locked behind a paywall for years, so here's how to install AltStore Beta for free.
1. Visit https://github.com/rileytestut/AltStore/blob/master/AltStore/Resources/apps.json and look for a Beta IPA (under com.rileytestut.AltStore.Beta)
2. Use normal AltStore to install that IPA
3. You now have AltStore Beta
