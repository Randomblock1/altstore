AltStore source with updated emulators, jailbreak apps, and tweaked apps ready to go.

Includes:
- apps.json: jailbreak apps, emulators, tweaked apps (cercube, snapchat++, IG rocket, watusi, etc.) and more! https://bit.ly/2UtmfSn
- beta-apps.json: modified AltStore source so you can download beta apps for free (if you can't use patreon like me) https://bit.ly/2xwEqOf

## how to use
1. install the altstore beta.
2. go to 'browse' tab
3. in the top right, click 'sources'
4. add whatever links above you want
5. to make sure everything works, close and reopen altstore

## if you can't use patreon
if you cannot use patreon (like me) for a variety of reasons, you can still use this! here's how:

1. download altpatcher (google it)
2. find the latest altstore beta ipa from https://cdn.altstore.io/file/altstore/apps.json
3. patch altserver with that ipa (shorten the link with bitly), altserver should close
4. reopen altserver and click 'install' to your device
5. altstore beta should now be installed to your device
